 **Design for a Flask Application for Tic Tac Toe**

**HTML Files**

* `index.html`: This file will be the home page of the application. It will contain a link to the game board and a brief description of the game.
* `game_board.html`: This file will contain the game board itself. It will be a grid of 9 squares, each of which can be clicked to place a mark.
* `winner.html`: This file will be displayed when a player wins the game. It will contain a message congratulating the winner and a link to the home page.

**Routes**

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file.
* `/game_board`: This route will render the `game_board.html` file.
* `/winner`: This route will render the `winner.html` file.

**Additional Features**

* The application could be enhanced with additional features, such as:
    * The ability to play against a computer opponent.
    * The ability to save and load games.
    * A排行榜 to track the scores of different players.

**Deployment**

The application can be deployed to a web server using Flask's built-in development server or a third-party web server such as Apache or Nginx.

**Conclusion**

This design provides a basic framework for a Flask application for Tic Tac Toe. The application can be easily customized and extended to add additional features.
